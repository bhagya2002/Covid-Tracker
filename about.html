                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses found mostly in animals. In humans, they can cause
                    diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory
                    Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The disease caused by the new
                    coronavirus has been named COVID-19.
                    <br><br>
                    While many of the characteristics of COVID-19 are still unknown, mild to severe illness has been
                    reported for confirmed cases.

                    Coronavirus is transmitted via liquid droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. The virus can enter
                    through these droplets through the eyes, nose or throat if you are in close contact.
                    <br><br>
                    The virus is not known to be airborne (e.g. transmitted through the particles floating in the air)
                    and it is not something that comes in through the skin.
                    <br><br>
                    It can be spread by touch if a person has used their hands to cover their mouth or nose when they
                    cough. That’s why we recommend you cough or sneeze into your arm and wash your hands regularly.

                    There are no vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19 yet. But, many clinical trials are
                    underway.
                    <br><br>
                    You may have questions about what medications your doctor can prescribe to treat COVID-19. Right
                    now, there are no specific treatments, vaccines or preventative medications for COVID-19. However,
                    researchers are working hard to find treatments that work.
                    <br><br>
                    Doctors don't know what harm existing medications and drugs may cause for people who have COVID-19.
                    We do
                    not recommend any existing drugs to treat COVID-19, except in clinical trials.
                    <br><br>
                    Most people with COVID-19 will recover on their own.
